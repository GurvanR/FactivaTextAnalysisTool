# FactivaTextAnalysisTool
Python text-analysis pseudo library specifically made to manipulate files from the Factiva database.

First download rtf files from the Factiva database : https://www.dowjones.com/professional/factiva/
which you can freely access if your are student in a ENS for instance, via this link (search for factiva) : 
https://bib.ens.psl.eu/ulm-lsh-jourdan-shs/collections/liste-des-bases-de-donnees-et-bouquets-de-revues-et-de-books-en

Note that you can download only 100 by 100 the articles in that database, which makes the collecting process a bit long and annoying.

Also note that you have to download **rtf** files and in the **good format** which is "Article Format" (try analyse with one batch of 100 articles before download furthermore articles)

Once you have your rtf files, download the repository and run the Tuto notebook to see what you can do with factiva files.

See requirements.txt to create the corresponding environment.

Enjoy and let me know if you have any remark or question.
